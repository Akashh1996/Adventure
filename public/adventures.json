He is an extremely professional guide and I felt secure following his advice. The canyon was great for beginners with a decent level of physical fitness and willingness to overcome some fears. I would totally repeat barranquismo in another canyon there."

We felt really safe and most importantly, had a lot of fun.\n\nThey first gave us every single detail regarding security and as we felt more expert, the level of entertainment went up higher. The nature surrounding is amazing and since we had ours in early July water was not cold but really refreshing.\n\nBig thanks to our lovely guide, Miguel, for his clear instructions and making rafting even more entertaining than it already is."

We came in the last day of the season, right before winter, so there wasn't too much water, but it's been said that in the spring the level of the water is much higher, reaching about 2 meters. Marc, our instructor, was real nice and super friendly and gave us a great time!\nYou get water suits and boots to change to in the toilet/showers/changing room before going on the rafts, so you don't need anything besides swimsuits. It's possible to leave your stuff at the site. You'll be driven back to the starting point by a minibus."

Our boat had a puncture in the main bottom section, which meant we completely flooded as soon as we hit the white water, making it impossible to steer and badly hurt my back on underwater rocks we should have floated over.\n\nHalf way down the boat was pumped up and emptied of water, but I felt we should have been taken back and offered the option of a refund or restart with a working boat, as the same thing happened again in the second section of rapids.\n\nQuality equipment should be a given for these sports considering the amount they cost and the experience would have been great if it wasn’t for this."

They knew the river well so could tell us where we could jump off high rocks, go down slides and under waterfalls.  They were so friendly and fun but safety conscious at the same time.  Highly recommend these guys.  Oh and the wetsuits they give you are high quality so kept us warm in a cold river!!"

A bonus were the pictures they took and sent trough afterwards. An extra plus was 'thanks to' the corona regulations, it was just us 4 and the guide which made it extra special.

They send you the reservation confirmation and advice on what clothes and shoes to wear. With the Covid issue, jumping with a mask is mandatory. It is not inconvenient and does not disturb the jump.\nThe meeting point is at the Castejón de Sos office, and from there they take you by van to the jump point.\nIt takes about 45 minutes to get to the highest point, with spectacular views while ascending, although it is a bumpy ride due to the bumping of the poor condition of the road. The problem is the track, which is shameful that it is not fixed and in good condition. I urge the Government of Aragon, the City Council, or whoever is concerned, ... to get down to work, since Castejón de Sos is one of the main paragliding spots in Europe, and it gives a very bad image how is the way up with the traffic that there is.\nThe companions of those who jump are given directions to easily walk along a path in which you reach the point where they land in 10 minutes, being able to take photos and watch how they descend. You can also go by car.\nIn our case, I must say that my mother-in-law finally fulfilled her dream at the age of 72, and her tandem flight from El Gallinero was spectacular. They treated her very well, and both takeoff and landing were perfect. She is looking forward to coming back. 😊"
