He is an extremely professional guide and I felt secure following his advice. The canyon was great for beginners with a decent level of physical fitness and willingness to overcome some fears. I would totally repeat barranquismo in another canyon there."

We felt really safe and most importantly, had a lot of fun.\n\nThey first gave us every single detail regarding security and as we felt more expert, the level of entertainment went up higher. The nature surrounding is amazing and since we had ours in early July water was not cold but really refreshing.\n\nBig thanks to our lovely guide, Miguel, for his clear instructions and making rafting even more entertaining than it already is."

We came in the last day of the season, right before winter, so there wasn't too much water, but it's been said that in the spring the level of the water is much higher, reaching about 2 meters. Marc, our instructor, was real nice and super friendly and gave us a great time!\nYou get water suits and boots to change to in the toilet/showers/changing room before going on the rafts, so you don't need anything besides swimsuits. It's possible to leave your stuff at the site. You'll be driven back to the starting point by a minibus."

Our boat had a puncture in the main bottom section, which meant we completely flooded as soon as we hit the white water, making it impossible to steer and badly hurt my back on underwater rocks we should have floated over.\n\nHalf way down the boat was pumped up and emptied of water, but I felt we should have been taken back and offered the option of a refund or restart with a working boat, as the same thing happened again in the second section of rapids.\n\nQuality equipment should be a given for these sports considering the amount they cost and the experience would have been great if it wasn‚Äôt for this."

They knew the river well so could tell us where we could jump off high rocks, go down slides and under waterfalls.  They were so friendly and fun but safety conscious at the same time.  Highly recommend these guys.  Oh and the wetsuits they give you are high quality so kept us warm in a cold river!!"

A bonus were the pictures they took and sent trough afterwards. An extra plus was 'thanks to' the corona regulations, it was just us 4 and the guide which made it extra special.
